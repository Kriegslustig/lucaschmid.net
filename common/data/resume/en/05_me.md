## About Me

[image:/img/resume/small_tumblr_nxysuzimJW1sfie3io1_1280.jpg]

I really enjoy programming. What I like most about it is learning new technologies. I like the fact that there are so many different ways of doing everything. You never have to (or can) stop learning new things.

During the past two years I've done a lot of work in JavaScript. I've come to really enjoy working with the language and its ecosystem. That's why I want to work as a front-end engineer.

When I'm not programming I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks or spend time out with my friends. I generally like to debate, especially about technology.
