## Why Wimdu

I want to work with an international team. Mainly because I believe, that diverse cultures keep companies agile and help their employees improve their skills. I want to start being an active member of the JavaScript community. That's hard to do from a rural area. Meet-ups and talking to other members of the community is a vital part of working in the Open-Source community. That's why I want to live in a vibrant city. As much as working in Open-Source, I also want to have a challenging job. My job must be a place, where I can learn something new every day. I believe, that working for Wimdu in Berlin can give me all of those things.
