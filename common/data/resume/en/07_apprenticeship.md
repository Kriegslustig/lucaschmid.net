## My Apprenticeship

As a mediamatician I acquired a very broad knowledge in multimedia. In my four-year-long apprenticeship, I have learned about the processes involved in video production, print and webdesign. My major, however, is in general computer science and programming. As part of my education, I studied managerial skills such as project management, economics and book keeping. The apprentice chooses which field they focus on. I went to vocational school one and a half days a week.

In the first year of my apprenticeship I got to work in many different departments of [Somedia](http://www.somedia.ch). After that though, I decidet to focus on programming. So in total I have over two years as a front-end engineer. The most notable was the news-site [suedostschweiz.ch](http://www.suedostschweiz.ch/). There I worked on evaluating the front-end technology stack. We sided for SASS and using BEM.
