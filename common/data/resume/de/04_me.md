## About Me

[image:/img/resume/tumblr_nxysuzimJW1sfie3io1_1280.jpg]

Over the last two Years I've worked a lot in JavaScript. I come to really enjoy working with the Language and its ecosystem. That's why I want to work as a front-end engineer.

 I really enjoy programming. What I like most about it, is learning new technologies. I like that there are so many different ways of doing everything. You never have to (or can) stop learning new things.

When I'm not programming I listen to podcasts and audiobooks or watch TV series. I generally like to debate, especially about technology.
