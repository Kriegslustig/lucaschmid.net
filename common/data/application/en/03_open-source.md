## My Work In Open-Source

. Most of my projects are on [Github](https://github.com/kriegslustig). I've done a lot of work in the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) community. My most popular project is [Altboiler](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/meteor-altboiler), which lets you render templates server-side in Meteor. Personally I think the [elm:make](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/meteor-elm-make) Meteor Package is much more interesting. It allows you to use Elm inside Meteor.
