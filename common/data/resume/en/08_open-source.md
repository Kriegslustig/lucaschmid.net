## My Work In Open-Source

Most of my spare time I spend working on side projects. Pretty much all of these are on [Github](https://github.com/kriegslustig). About half of these are simply to explore new technologies. With the other half I tried to provide some actual value. I've done a lot of work in the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) community. My most popular project (by Github _"Stars"_) is [Altboiler](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/meteor-altboiler), which lets you render templates server-side in Meteor. Personally I think the [elm:make](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/meteor-elm-make) Meteor Package is my most interesting project. It allows users to use Elm inside Meteor. Another way in which I helped the community, was answering questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4386702/kriegslustig) and on IRC. For a short period StackOverflow was the my most time consuming hobby.
