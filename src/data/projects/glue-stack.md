# Glue-Stack

The Glue-stack is a framework to create web-applications. It combines Express, Browserify, Handlebars, Riot.js and PostCSS to generate static HTML. The dynamic parts are displayed using Riot.js and may be loaded in JSON over XHR or WebSockets.

There's still a lot of work to do. The stack is pretty neat. But I'll probably need to make the watcher an NPM module and make it configurable. I also want to add some tools to make creating JSON APIs easier.
