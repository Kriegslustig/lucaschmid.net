## My Apprenticeship

[image:/img/resume/small_tumblr_nxysurSX2M1sfie3io1_1280.jpg]

As a mediamatician I have a very broad knowledge in multimedia. In my four-year-long apprenticeship, I have learned about the processes involved in video production, print and webdesign. Another important part of the apprenticeship is general computer science and programming. I have also learned managerial tasks like project management, economics and book keeping. The apprentice chooses which field they focus on. For the practical part of my apprenticeship I focused on programming.
