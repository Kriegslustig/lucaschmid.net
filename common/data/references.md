I wrote about some of my Projects on the [projects page](/projects)

Most of my work (including [this Website](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/lucaschmid.net)) is on my [Github profile](https://github.com/Kriegslustig).

I am a somewhat active member of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4386702/kriegslustig).

Sometimes I also like to do challenges on [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/users/Kriegslustig).
