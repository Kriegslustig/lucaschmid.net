## My Apprenticeship

[image:/img/application/tumblr_nxysurSX2M1sfie3io1_1280.jpg]

As a mediamatician I have a very broad knowledge in multimedia. I have learned about the processes in video production, print and webdesign. Another important part of the apprenticeship is general computer science and programming. I have also learned managerial tasks like project management, economics and even book keeping. The apprentice chooses which field they focus on. At work I focused on programming.
