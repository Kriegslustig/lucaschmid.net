## Why Wimdu

I want to work with an international team. Mainly because I believe, that diverse cultures keep companies agile and help their employees improve their skills set. An important goal of mine, is to start being an active member of the JavaScript community. That's hard to do from a rural area. Meet-ups and talking to other members of the community is a vital part of working on open-source projects. That's why I want to live in a vibrant city. As much as I want to work in Open-Source, I also want to have a challenging job. My job must be a place, where I can learn something new every day. I believe, that working for Wimdu in Berlin can give me all of those things.
