## About Me

I enjoy coding and learning new technologies. There are countless ways of solving problems. Exploring those options excites me every day. You never have to stop learning new things.

During the past two years I have written a lot of code in JavaScript. I've come to really enjoy working with the language and its ecosystem. My favourite language mostly runs in browsers, that is why I want to work as a front-end engineer.

Programming is not the only thing I like to do in my free time. I also listen to a lot of podcasts and audio books and love spending time out with my friends. I generally like to discuss things, especially technology.
