## My Apprenticeship

As a mediamatician I acquired a very broad knowledge in multimedia. In my four-year-long apprenticeship, I have learned about the processes involved in video production, print and webdesign. My major, however, is in general computer science and programming. As part of my education, I studied managerial skills such as project management, economics and book keeping. The apprentice chooses which field they focus on. For the practical part of my apprenticeship I focused on programming.
