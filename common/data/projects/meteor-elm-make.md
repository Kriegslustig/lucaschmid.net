# The `elm:make` Meteor package

[`elm:make`](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/meteor-elm-make) is a Meteor package that compiles Elm inside Meteor projects. I wrote it because I like both Elm and Meteor. At first I thought it would be pretty easy to implement. But it turned out to be really challenging. Meteors build system was pretty hard to pair with Elm-make. Elm-make doesn't really provide any kind of API for node. This means, it requires directories containing Elm files. The Meteor build plugin API doesn't provide any way to store temporary files. The API lets you loop over an array of changed files. Build plugins don't know where those files are. They only know their contents and name. That means, that I had to implement `elm:make` to create a `.elm` directory inside the Meteor projects root directory. That is suboptimal. This means, that you can't create a package using `elm:make` to compile parts of it. When you'd install such a package, `elm:make` would polute the projects root directory in an intransparen way.
