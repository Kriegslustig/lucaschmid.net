## About Me

I enjoy coding and learning new technologies. I like the fact that there are so many different ways of doing everything. You never have to stop learning new things.

During the past two years I've written a lot of code in JavaScript. I've come to really enjoy working with the language and its ecosystem. I want to work as a front-end engineer because my favourite language mostly runs in browsers.

Programming is not the only thing I do. I also listen to a lot of podcasts and audio books and love spending time out with my friends. I generally like to discuss things, especially technology.
