    <h1 id="hi">Hi!</h1>

<p>My name is Luca Nils Schmid.</p>

<h2 id="howilearnedtoprogram">How I learned to program</h2>

<p>My favourite hobby is programming. I started my apprenticeship as a <em>mediamatic technician</em> (yes, that's a thing) at <a href="http://www.somedia.ch/">Somedia</a> in 2012. During that time I got to work in many different departments. Their <a href="http://www.somedia-production.ch/web/">Web-agency</a>, their <a href="http://www.somedia-production.ch/print/">consumer print product department</a>, the IT-department (wich doesn't have a Website) and the <a href="http://www.somedia-production.ch/video/">Video-agency</a>. As part of my training <a href="https://twitter.com/swissspidy">@swisspidy</a> taught me some basic HTML, CSS and PHP. After a few weeks of that I was moved to the IT department. At that point, I didn't even know what an Array was. During that time I started creating my own little Websites at home. I love to dabble and constantly learn new things. On the christmas-holiday in 2013 I found an easy introduction course on jQuery. I hardly even knew how to spell JavaScript. But I loved the idea of creating more dynamic Websites. After that I wanted to make my first real Website. I chose to do it in WordPress. I started to create some packages for the framework because I didn't like the existing solutions. They all suck. Mainly because I was to lazy to <strong>RTFM</strong>. I even started to read some of the WordPress source-code to figure out some of the badly documented parts of WordPress. Finally in 2014 I created a Github-account in order to publish Lightr. It was a <strong>really</strong> bad, but working code-highlighter which I seem to have never actually managed pushed to the <a href="https://github.com/Kriegslustig/Lightr">repo</a>. During that time I also started to host my stuff on my own virtual hosts. I worked with <a href="https://fabianhauser.ch">Fabian Hauser</a> at the time. He helped me greatly with my experiments with Linux. I got bored with WordPress fairly quickly and started dabbling with node.js in January of 2015. That's when I really learned JavaScript. Then in March I discovered Meteor. I loved it, because was really easy to get into. Then I went on to create a few projects in Meteor.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Around April I joined the Linux system administration team at work. There I got to know Apache, MySQL and Linux. In december I went to a Dupal team. At the time of this writting I'm still part of that team.</p>

<p>In August 2016 I will graduate from my apprenticeship. Then I want to start working as a JavaScript-Developer.</p>
